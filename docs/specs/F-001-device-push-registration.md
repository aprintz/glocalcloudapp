# F-001: Device Push Registration

## Overview
Secure device registration for push notifications using native platform services and Azure Notification Hub, with encrypted token management and cross-platform support.

## User Story
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** my device to receive push notifications reliably  
**So that** I can be alerted about location-based events, geofence triggers, and other real-time updates even when the app is closed or backgrounded

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Platform Registration
- **Given** a user opens the app for the first time
- **When** the app requests notification permissions
- **Then** the system should register with the appropriate platform service:
  - iOS: Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
  - Android: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
  - Web: Web Push API with VAPID keys

### AC-002: Azure Notification Hub Integration
- **Given** a device has obtained a platform push token
- **When** the registration process begins
- **Then** the device should register with Azure Notification Hub
- **And** receive a unique registration ID
- **And** be tagged with relevant user/device metadata

### AC-003: Token Security
- **Given** a push token is received from the platform
- **When** storing or transmitting the token
- **Then** the token must be hashed using SHA-256
- **And** encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
- **And** only encrypted tokens are transmitted to backend services

### AC-004: Registration Refresh
- **Given** a push token expires or changes
- **When** the platform provides a new token
- **Then** the app should automatically re-register
- **And** update the Azure Notification Hub registration
- **And** invalidate the previous encrypted token

### AC-005: User Consent Management
- **Given** a user is prompted for push notification permissions
- **When** the user denies permission
- **Then** the app should gracefully handle the rejection
- **And** provide alternative notification methods (in-app only)
- **And** allow the user to enable notifications later in settings

### AC-006: Registration Persistence
- **Given** a successful push registration
- **When** the app is restarted
- **Then** the registration should persist
- **And** be validated against the server
- **And** refresh if expired or invalid

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Registration must complete within 10 seconds under normal network conditions
- Token encryption/decryption must not exceed 100ms
- Failed registrations must retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)

### Reliability
- 99.5% registration success rate for devices with valid network connectivity
- Automatic recovery from temporary network failures
- Graceful degradation when Azure Notification Hub is unavailable

### Scalability
- Support for 100,000+ concurrent device registrations
- Efficient batch processing for token updates
- Rate limiting protection (max 10 registration attempts per device per hour)

### Compatibility
- iOS 14.0+ (minimum deployment target)
- Android API 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- Modern web browsers with Push API support
- Expo SDK 50+ compatibility

## Privacy Requirements

### Data Minimization
- Only store encrypted push tokens and necessary metadata
- Automatically purge inactive device registrations after 90 days
- No storage of personal data in push token records

### User Control
- Clear opt-in consent flow with explanation of notification types
- Granular notification category preferences
- Easy opt-out mechanism with immediate effect
- Export/deletion of registration data on request

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for all token transmission
- Secure key management using platform keychain/keystore
- Regular rotation of encryption keys (every 90 days)
- Audit logging for all registration events

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Mutual TLS for all Azure Notification Hub communications
- JWT-based authentication for backend API calls
- Device attestation where supported by platform

### Token Security
- Salted hashing using cryptographically secure random salts
- AES-256-GCM encryption with unique initialization vectors
- Secure key derivation using PBKDF2 with 100,000+ iterations
- Hardware security module usage where available

### Transport Security
- TLS 1.3 minimum for all network communications
- Certificate pinning for Azure Notification Hub endpoints
- Request signing to prevent replay attacks
- API rate limiting and abuse detection

### Data Validation
- Strict input validation for all registration parameters
- Token format validation before processing
- Sanitization of user-provided metadata
- SQL injection and XSS protection

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Components
```typescript
interface PushRegistrationService {
  requestPermissions(): Promise<NotificationPermissionStatus>;
  registerDevice(): Promise<RegistrationResult>;
  updateRegistration(): Promise<void>;
  unregisterDevice(): Promise<void>;
  getRegistrationStatus(): RegistrationStatus;
}

interface EncryptedToken {
  encryptedValue: string;
  iv: string;
  salt: string;
  algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM';
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Server-Side Integration
```typescript
interface AzureNotificationHubConfig {
  connectionString: string;
  hubName: string;
  enableTestSend: boolean;
  defaultTags: string[];
}

interface DeviceRegistration {
  deviceId: string;
  platform: 'ios' | 'android' | 'web';
  encryptedToken: EncryptedToken;
  registrationId: string;
  tags: string[];
  expiresAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics

## Open Questions

1. **Token Rotation Strategy**: Should we implement proactive token rotation or only refresh on platform-initiated changes?

2. **Offline Registration**: How should the app handle registration attempts when offline? Queue for later or fail immediately?

3. **Multi-Device Support**: How should we handle users with multiple devices? Link registrations to user accounts?

4. **Push Notification Categories**: What granular notification categories should be supported (e.g., location alerts, social updates, system messages)?

5. **Background Registration**: Should token refresh happen in background app refresh, or only when app is active?

6. **Azure Notification Hub Alternatives**: Should we implement fallback push providers in case Azure Notification Hub is unavailable?

7. **Testing Environment**: How should we distinguish between production and development push registrations to avoid test notifications reaching real users?

8. **GDPR Compliance**: What additional measures are needed for EU users regarding push token data processing and storage?

9. **Platform-Specific Features**: Should we leverage platform-specific features like iOS Critical Alerts or Android notification channels?

10. **Registration Analytics**: What additional telemetry should be collected to optimize registration success rates?
