# F-003: Geofence Notification Delivery

## Overview
Advanced geofence notification system supporting both point-based (circular) and polygon-based geofences with intelligent notification suppression, hysteresis algorithms, and real-time delivery mechanisms to prevent notification spam while ensuring reliable location-based alerts.

## User Story
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** to receive timely and relevant notifications when I enter or exit specific geographic areas  
**So that** I can be reminded of location-based tasks, receive local information, and be alerted to important events without being overwhelmed by duplicate or irrelevant notifications

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Point-Based Geofence Support
- **Given** a user creates a circular geofence with center coordinates and radius
- **When** the user's location is determined
- **Then** the system should:
  - Calculate distance from location to geofence center using great-circle distance
  - Trigger entry notification when distance ≤ radius
  - Trigger exit notification when distance > radius + hysteresis buffer
  - Support radius ranges from 10 meters to 100 kilometers
  - Handle multiple overlapping circular geofences

### AC-002: Polygon-Based Geofence Support
- **Given** a user creates a polygon geofence with multiple coordinate points
- **When** the user's location is evaluated
- **Then** the system should:
  - Use ray casting algorithm to determine point-in-polygon inclusion
  - Support polygons with 3-1000 vertices
  - Handle complex polygons with holes (donut shapes)
  - Trigger entry/exit notifications based on polygon boundary crossing
  - Efficiently process multiple polygon geofences simultaneously

### AC-003: Notification Suppression Logic
- **Given** a user enters a geofence
- **When** determining whether to send a notification
- **Then** the system should suppress notifications if:
  - Same geofence notification was sent within the last 30 minutes (configurable)
  - User is in "Do Not Disturb" mode during configured quiet hours
  - User has reached daily notification limit (default: 20 per day)
  - Geofence is temporarily disabled by user or system
  - Location accuracy is below confidence threshold (>50m uncertainty)

### AC-004: Hysteresis Implementation
- **Given** a geofence boundary with potential GPS noise
- **When** user location fluctuates near the boundary
- **Then** the system should:
  - Implement entry hysteresis buffer (5-10% of geofence size, min 10m)
  - Implement exit hysteresis buffer (10-15% of geofence size, min 15m)
  - Require sustained presence outside boundary before triggering exit
  - Prevent rapid entry/exit notification cycling
  - Adjust hysteresis based on location accuracy confidence

### AC-005: Real-Time Delivery Mechanisms
- **Given** a geofence trigger event occurs
- **When** the notification should be delivered
- **Then** the system should:
  - Deliver push notifications to active devices within 10 seconds
  - Fall back to in-app notifications if push notifications fail
  - Support immediate delivery for high-priority geofences
  - Queue notifications for delivery when app is next opened
  - Provide delivery confirmation and read receipts

### AC-006: Geofence State Management
- **Given** multiple geofences are active
- **When** tracking user location
- **Then** the system should:
  - Maintain current state (inside/outside) for each geofence
  - Persist state across app restarts and device reboots
  - Handle state transitions accurately with timestamps
  - Support bulk state queries for dashboard views
  - Provide state change history for analytics

### AC-007: Notification Customization
- **Given** a geofence is configured
- **When** setting up notifications
- **Then** users should be able to:
  - Customize notification messages for entry and exit events
  - Set notification priority levels (low, normal, high, critical)
  - Choose notification types (push, in-app, email, SMS)
  - Configure notification timing (immediate, delayed, scheduled)
  - Set quiet hours when notifications are suppressed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Geofence evaluation must complete within 500ms for up to 100 active geofences
- Notification delivery latency must not exceed 10 seconds end-to-end
- Point-in-polygon calculations must complete within 50ms per polygon
- State persistence operations must complete within 100ms

### Accuracy
- Point-based geofence accuracy: ±95% within defined radius + location uncertainty
- Polygon-based geofence accuracy: ±90% for boundary detection
- Hysteresis effectiveness: <5% false positive entry/exit notifications
- Notification timing accuracy: ±30 seconds for non-immediate delivery

### Scalability
- Support 1000+ active geofences per user
- Handle 10,000+ simultaneous users with geofence monitoring
- Process 100,000+ location updates per minute
- Scale notification delivery to 1M+ notifications per day

### Reliability
- 99.5% notification delivery success rate
