# F-002: User Location Ingestion

## Overview
Comprehensive user location data collection system with configurable accuracy settings, intelligent periodic updates, and robust idempotency mechanisms to support geospatial features while preserving battery life and user privacy.

## User Story
**As a** mobile app user  
**I want** my location to be tracked efficiently and accurately  
**So that** I can receive relevant location-based notifications, find nearby points of interest, and share my location with authorized contacts while maintaining control over my privacy and device battery life

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Location Permission Management
- **Given** a user opens the app requiring location services
- **When** location permissions are not granted
- **Then** the app should request appropriate permissions:
  - "When in Use" for basic functionality
  - "Always" for background geofence monitoring (with clear explanation)
  - Precise location access on iOS 14+ (with user choice)
- **And** gracefully handle permission denial with alternative flows

### AC-002: Adaptive Location Accuracy
- **Given** the app needs location data
- **When** determining the appropriate accuracy level
- **Then** the system should select accuracy based on:
  - Current battery level (high accuracy when >50% battery)
  - User movement state (higher accuracy when moving)
  - Active features (maximum accuracy for navigation, balanced for geofencing)
  - Network connectivity (optimize for cellular vs WiFi)
  - User preferences and power saving mode

### AC-003: Intelligent Periodic Updates
- **Given** location tracking is active
- **When** the system determines update intervals
- **Then** updates should be dynamically adjusted based on:
  - User velocity (10 seconds when moving fast, 60 seconds when stationary)
  - Proximity to geofences (5 seconds near boundaries, 30 seconds distant)
  - Application state (foreground vs background)
  - Battery level (longer intervals when battery <20%)
  - Significant location changes (immediate update on movement >100m)

### AC-004: Location Data Validation
- **Given** a location reading is received
- **When** processing the location data
- **Then** the system should validate:
  - Coordinate bounds (valid latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
  - Accuracy threshold (reject readings with accuracy >100m unless specified)
  - Timestamp freshness (reject readings older than 5 minutes)
  - Movement plausibility (flag movements exceeding 300 km/h)
  - GPS signal strength and satellite count

### AC-005: Idempotency and Deduplication
- **Given** multiple location updates are generated
- **When** sending data to the server
- **Then** the system should:
  - Generate unique identifiers for each location reading
  - Implement client-side deduplication within 30-second windows
  - Use server-side idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing
  - Handle network retry scenarios without creating duplicates
  - Maintain ordered sequence numbers for location timeline

### AC-006: Offline Data Management
- **Given** the device loses network connectivity
- **When** location updates are generated
- **Then** the system should:
  - Store up to 1000 location points locally
  - Implement circular buffer to prevent excessive storage
  - Retry failed uploads with exponential backoff
  - Compress and batch location data for efficient transmission
  - Sync stored data when connectivity is restored

### AC-007: Background Location Handling
- **Given** the app is backgrounded
- **When** location tracking continues
- **Then** the system should:
  - Reduce update frequency to preserve battery
  - Use significant location change APIs
  - Maintain geofence monitoring capabilities
  - Respect system background execution limits
  - Provide clear user indication of background tracking
